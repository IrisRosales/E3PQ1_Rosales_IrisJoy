<p class="tab" class="indent"><br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During my first years in college, I thought it was going to be hard, I was so nervous before I enter college but I managed to study well and luckily got into one of the tops in our class. I actually wasn’t expecting that much, just aiming myself to pass. I was so happy that my grades are qualified for an academic scholarship and I did apply. I've been an academic scholar for consecutive 2 years.<br><br>
 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And so pandemic came, things got harder and so our subjects. I never thought that were going to have online classes. It really feels different than having face-to-face classes at school. It’s more out of focusing and really hard to learn, and I am not privileged enough before to have any equipment to use for online classes other than my phone.<br><br>
 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am currently in the second semester of my third year. All of our subjects that we're taking were majors. We even have capstone on this sem, hope we all get pass and learn well on this subjects. Even though I am not an academic scholar anymore, I am aiming to pass, learn, and graduate ~ hopefully with the dean's lister if I can.<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After I graduate, I will find a job that suits my course and will help to improve my programming skills or in any field-related jobs.
